## Multimodal Large Language Models for Healthcare

Recent advances in medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled integration of diverse data types—clinical reports, images, and knowledge graphs—within unified, interpretable frameworks for healthcare AI. This tutorial covers concepts, real-world applications, and hands-on techniques to adapt these models for use in clinical practice.
